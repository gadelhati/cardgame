# _Card Game_

## Rules

- Each player drags one card at a time, from the source field to the destination field
    - from a field origin: deck, hand, desk or trash;
    - to another field, destination: deck, hand, desk or trash or to a card.
        - skills can be activated when drag or when drop;
        - in a specific field
- If the card has an effect, that effect will have an origin, a destination, and a consequence
- The turn passes when the card is droped

## Card construction
### Border
    The card features a clean outer border (padding) colored according to its archetype.
    
- Archetype Color (e.g., blue, green, etc.): The archetype's color changes during card creation and becomes fixed once published. After, it may be adjusted in response to balance updates (buffs or nerfs)
    - The card may have up to two archetypes, and the border should visually represent both (e.g., gradient on each side).

### Top Section
- Top-left: Resource cost, visually coded with the color associated with the card’s rarity tier.
    - The cost is the primary balancing parameter and may be adjusted through buffs or nerfs..
- Top-right: Combat statistics displayed as ATK / DEF

### Artwork Layout
    The illustration occupies the entire card background and uses a four-layer parallax composition:
- Title Layer: The card title positioned at the bottom of the artwork, expressive lettering integrated into the scene.
- Foreground: Character in a dynamic action pose.
- Midground: Environmental scenery elements.
- Background: Sky, distant atmospheric elements, or large-scale environmental elements.

### Text Area (Lower Half)
    A translucent rectangular panel overlays the lower portion of the card, ensuring readability while preserving visual depth
- Card effect (if exists), on the same line:
    - left: cause(effect cost)
    - center: effect name
    - right: consequence.
        - duration
- Default effect description in parentheses (if exists)
- Lore text, displayed in italic style
